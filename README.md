is much greater than females at those times.

*Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional 
	visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.

	In August of 2019 the data of NYC Citibike users can be broken down into many revelations of information.
	Before looking at the numbers evaluated one might assume NYC is typically flooded with tourists evenly
	representing a balance of genders during this month. One might even think these season would be accompanied
	by a huge influx of biking customers on Saturdays and Sundays. False. By crunching the data for this 
	month and analyzing all 2,344,224 NYC CitiBike rides, another pattern emerges. It is the CitiBike Subscriber
	that is the main frequent usertype. Not just any subscriber, but especially the male delcared subscribers.
	NYC draws a great number males that use CitiBike for the Monday through Friday morning and evenings bike 
	rides. Is CitiBike their main method of commuting to work? Zoom into the map to follow the patterns of 
	top starting locations to draw conclusions. 
	Given this pattern from NYC CitiBike Data one may present that another populous city may be able to successfully
	target their daily local commuters, especially the males, for their main usertype.
	Information gleaned from the United Stated Census Bureau may be another vital source of numbers to analyze.

	Des Moines itself is a growing metropolis but it does have a smaller population, nearly a tenth of the population per square mile compared to NYC.
